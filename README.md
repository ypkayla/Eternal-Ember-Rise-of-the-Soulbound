# Eternal Ember: Rise of the Soulbound

**Eternal Ember: Rise of the Soulbound** is an anime-inspired RPG game built using Python. The game features a complex character progression system, item and inventory management, quests, crafting, and combat mechanics, offering players an immersive and engaging experience.

   - **NPC Interactions:** Interact with NPCs to gain quests, buy/sell items, and gather lore about the game world.

## Technologies Used
